How to report a bug
-------------------

Report bugs on the `Issue
Tracker <https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python-instance/issues>`__.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

-  Which operating system and Python version are you using?
-  Which version of this project are you using?
-  What did you do?
-  What did you expect to see?
-  What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case, and/or
steps to reproduce the issue.

How to request a feature
------------------------

Request features on the `Issue
Tracker <https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python-instance/issues>`__.

How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.6+ and the following tools:

-  `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__
-  `Nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`__

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

You can now run an interactive Python session, or the command-line
interface:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python
   $ poetry run cookiecutter-hypermodern-python-instance

How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session. For example, invoke the unit
test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory, and are written using
the `pytest <https://pytest.readthedocs.io/>`__ testing framework.

How to submit changes
---------------------

Open a `pull
request <https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python-instance/pulls>`__
to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

-  The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
-  Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
-  If your changes add functionality, update the documentation
   accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

You can ensure that your changes adhere to the code style by
reformatting with `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/>`__:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=black

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate
your approach.
